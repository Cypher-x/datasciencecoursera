As part of the Data sciences, Getting and Cleaning Data course, the "run_analysis.R" code was designed to clean the HAR raw data set.

Procedure:

1) Download the raw HAR data via the link above into your  working directory.

2) Within the "run_analysis.R" program:
	dir <- "set to your file path .../UCI HAR Dataset
		make sure the file contains the text file "features.txt"
	test_dir <- "set to your file path .../UCI HAR Dataset/test
	train_dir <- "set to your file path .../UCI HAR Dataset/train
3) Run the code.
